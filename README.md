Snippets makes it easy to organize and save code for later use.

## Overview
Searching for logic needed to make your app work often takes __A LOT__ of googling and review of hundreds of lines of code. Snippets is a place where you can select a category (i.e., HTML, CSS, Javascript, Sequelize) and save code or links that can be stored and retreived when needed for future projects.


## Features
:boom: A login and sign up page that requires email and password authentication. A user cannot move forward without both a valid email and password.

:boom: Users can select a category and search for code. This is useful as we often cannot memorize code and recall it months later when needed. New snippets are created by clickng on the New Snippet button

:boom: To save a new snippet enter a title, category, paste or write a new snippet, add a comment (optional), and click the create button.


## Modules:
We used several new NPMs in this project including Prettier to format our code, Passport for verifying username and password credentials, bCrypt for hasing and salting passwords, and body-parser.
* [Prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier)
* [Passport](https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport)
* [bCrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt)
* [Body-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser)


## Future Developments
Time permitting we would like to add these features:
* ---Tie logged in user to Snippets---
* Personalized view
* Allow users to create and delete their own categories.
* Importing/Exporting
* Implement Dark Mode
